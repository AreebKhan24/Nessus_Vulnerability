Here we've set up our virtual machine and found its IP address, then created a new scan on Nessus for it<br/>

<br />
<br />
To enable Nessus to have a in depth scan of our Virtua Machine, we first enable remote registry in our environment (Start up type = Automatic)<br/>

<br />
<br />
Allow for our machine to be susceptible to more harm via User Account Settings (Set to Never Notify) <br/>

<br />
<br />
To ensure that vulnerabilities will be found on Nessus, lets download an very old version (2015) of Mozilla Firefox <br/>

<br />
<br />
In order for Nessus to have an in depth scan, we'll add the credentials needed to sign into our virtual machine<br/>

<br />
<br />
After the scan has completed we can see just how many critical vulnerabilities there are on our virtual machine<br/>

<br />
<br />
Clicking the remediation tab in our scan shows us how we can see what needs to be fixed and how to do it<br/>

<br />
To Remediate, we will uninstall Mozilla<br/>

<br />
And update Windows!<br/>

After remediating and rescanning using Nessus, the critical vulnerabilities have been fixed! <br/>
